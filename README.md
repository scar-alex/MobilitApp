## Mobility Information

MobilitApp records synchronously and while running in the background, periodic location updates from its users. The information obtained is processed to analyze the mode of transportation used by the user. At the moment we are able to recognise: bus, car, metro, train, bicycle and on foot.

Users are then able to visualize on a map, their locations history day by day. The user's information is treated completely anonymous.
